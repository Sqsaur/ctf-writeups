## 🍹 About

This repository contains write-ups from my journey through **OWASP Juice Shop**, an intentionally insecure web application designed to teach web vulnerabilities.  
My goal is to strengthen my practical skills in offensive security by solving real-world inspired challenges and documenting the process.

## 🧮 Difficulty Scale

Each challenge is assigned a **difficulty score** (1.0–5.0):

- 🔹 **1.0 – 1.5**: Very easy, can be solved just by clicking around  
- 🔸 **2.0 – 3.0**: Medium, requires light recon or technical testing  
- 🔺 **3.5 – 5.0**: Advanced, may require chaining techniques, scripting, or in-depth analysis

The ratings are based on my opinion.
